# Traditional Italian Food Restaurant

Traditional central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino. In Tuscany, pasta (especially pappardelle) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). In southern Italy, tomatoes (fresh or cooked into tomato sauce), peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, oranges, ricotta cheese, eggplants, zucchini, certain types of fish (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.

The folowing code is a simple frontend code using html, css and js. I practiced it by downloading a free psd file from google.

Since it is a progressive web app, you can also install the web application in your smart phones, tablets, desktops etc.
